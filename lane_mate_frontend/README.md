Carrier quote management for Freight Brokerages

## Use Case Summary

Freight brokers act as an intermediary between shippers, who have freight to ship, and carriers, who have trucks to move it.
A shipper will give a contract to move a load to a broker, who will then hire a carrier to peform the work.
Often, a broker will have to go to the open market to find a truck to complete the job and 'cover the load.'
This involves posting the load on a loadboard, inviting several carriers to call the broker and make an offer on the load.

lane_mate is a simple application that handles the data entry involved in receiving spot market quotes from trucking companies in real time over the phone.
